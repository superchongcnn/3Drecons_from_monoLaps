 3d Reconstruction from Monocular Medical Lapscope 2d Images


Creating a 3D reconstruction from monocular medical laparoscope 2D images is a complex task that involves several advanced techniques in computer vision and image processing. Here's a high-level overview and a simplified project using Python and libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy.

Project Overview
1. Image Acquisition: Capture or load a sequence of 2D images from the laparoscope.
2. Feature Detection and Matching: Detect and match features across the images.
3. Camera Pose Estimation: Estimate the camera poses relative to the observed features.
4. 3D Point Cloud Generation: Triangulate the matched features to generate a 3D point cloud.
5. Surface Reconstruction: Reconstruct a 3D surface from the point cloud.


To use this project:

Create the directory structure as shown above
Install the requirements:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Place your laparoscope images in the data/raw_images directory
Calibrate your laparoscope camera and update the camera parameters in config.py

Run the main script:
python main.py

Key Features of this Implementation:

Modular Design: The code is organized into logical components for easy maintenance and modification.
Robust Feature Detection: Uses SIFT features for reliable point matching.
Advanced Preprocessing: Includes contrast enhancement and denoising for medical images.
Flexible Configuration: All parameters are centralized in the config file.
Surface Reconstruction: Implements Poisson surface reconstruction for creating a mesh from the point cloud.
Additional Considerations:

1.Error handling should be added throughout the code
2.Add logging for debugging and monitoring
3.Implement progress tracking for long reconstructions
4.Add validation steps for the reconstruction quality
5.Consider adding GPU acceleration for larger datasets
6.Add documentation for camera calibration procedure
