 3d Reconstruction from Monocular Medical Lapscope 2d Images


Creating a 3D reconstruction from monocular medical laparoscope 2D images is a complex task that involves several advanced techniques in computer vision and image processing. Here's a high-level overview and a simplified project using Python and libraries such as OpenCV and NumPy.

Project Overview
1. Image Acquisition: Capture or load a sequence of 2D images from the laparoscope.
2. Feature Detection and Matching: Detect and match features across the images.
3. Camera Pose Estimation: Estimate the camera poses relative to the observed features.
4. 3D Point Cloud Generation: Triangulate the matched features to generate a 3D point cloud.
5. Surface Reconstruction: Reconstruct a 3D surface from the point cloud.
